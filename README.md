## Ping
### Written By: wren withers

This is a program called ping-pong. It's very similar to the popular coding challenge fizz-buzz, and allows a user to submit 
a number, which then appears as a count on the page. Within the count, for every multiple of three the word "ping" will appear, for every 
for a multiple of five the word "pong" will appear, and for each multiple of 15 the words "ping-pong" will appear.

####To use, simply open the html page in your browser, and have at.

####This program utilizes css, js, and bootstrap, and there are currently no known glitches.
